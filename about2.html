        <h1>HISTORY OF GUSEC</h1>
        <p>
            GUSEC is an early stage, zero-day, zero-cost, startup support system with a mission to convert 1% of 1.5
            million higher education students in the Gujarat region into entrepreneurs, building economic and growth
            value from within a university ecosystem.

            GUSECâ€™s vision is to give an accelerated platform to idea-level entrepreneurs and support them with the
            necessary resources and mentorship to build real value from their current ideas.

            Incorporated as a section 8(a) not-for-profit company, governed by an independent Board of Directors
            comprising University faculty, industry representatives, and the Vice-Chancellor as the Chair. Day-to-day
            operations are led by a CEO and a dedicated team.

            GUSEC works with a zero-day zero-cost startup support model, which puts an imperative emphasis on offering
            no-cost startup support, especially to the idea/early-stage startups during their pre-incubation, incubation
            and acceleration periods to help them experiment and grow with their ideas. This model helps them to
            accelerate their ideas with a build fast, break fast ideology.
